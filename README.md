# ELLE Mobile
ELLE Mobile is a pair of Unity games created by the second ELLE senior design group at UCF.


## ELLE Mobile3D
This game has two gamemodes, one matches the gameplay of the original ELLE 1.0 over-the-shoulder mode and the other is an augmented reality scavenger hunt for translated words. It connects to [this API](https://github.com/ItsNotRick/elle-web-service) to download language packs and stores them locally.

### For readers wishing to contribute to ELLEMobile3D
Read these C# files:
###### Language Pack Code
* LoginMangager.cs
* SessionManager.cs
* LanguagePackInterface.cs
###### Game Logic
* GroundGeneration.cs
* PlayerMovementControls.cs
### Potential Additions:
* Music, menu music, in-game music, etc.
* More efficient language pack downloading
* Speed up the gameplay as the player successfully dodges obstacles
* More obvious, easier to see obstacles
* Better performance data collection
* A disabled speech based gamemode could be reworked and re-integrated with the game

## ELLE Mobile2D
Most of the Language pack code is the same as Mobile3D, the gameplay is a bit simplistic and there's a huge amount of time the player spends not answering questions. This game could benefit from a gameplay overhaul.
